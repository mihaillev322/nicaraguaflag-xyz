The Pacific coast extends approximately 350 kilometers while the Caribbean coast stretches 541 kilometers. The white stripe symbolizes peace, purity, and the land between these two oceans. This color scheme originated with the Federal Republic of Central America in 1823, and Nicaragua has maintained it throughout its history to honor that shared heritage. The specific cobalt blue shade used today was standardized in 1971 to ensure consistent reproduction across all official flags."

Inside the triangle are five volcanoes rising from water, representing both the five original Central American federation states and Nicaragua's volcanic geography. Above the volcanoes sits a rainbow symbolizing peace and hope, topped by a red Phrygian cap representing liberty and freedom. The triangle is encircled by text reading 'REPÚBLICA DE NICARAGUA' on top and 'AMÉRICA CENTRAL' on the bottom. The entire emblem uses gold, blue, green, and rainbow colors, and measures exactly one-fifth the height of the flag. This coat of arms has been used since 1971 in its current standardized form."

While the basic blue-white-blue horizontal stripe pattern dates back to 1823 when Nicaragua was part of the Federal Republic of Central America, and was restored in 1908 after brief modifications, the 1971 decree specifically standardized every detail. This included the exact shade of cobalt blue, the precise proportions of the coat of arms, and the specific elements within the triangle emblem. The 1971 standardization ensures that all official Nicaraguan flags maintain consistent appearance whether displayed domestically or internationally. This version has remained unchanged for over 50 years, making it one of the more stable flag designs in Central American history."

Two cobalt blue stripes occupy the top and bottom positions, while a white stripe runs through the middle. Each stripe takes up exactly one-third of the flag's total height. The flag's overall proportions follow a 3:5 aspect ratio, meaning the height is three units while the length extends five units. This three-stripe design has been a consistent feature of Nicaragua's flag since the country joined the Federal Republic of Central America in 1823, though the exact shade of blue and other details have been refined over time."

        "text": "Yes, Nicaragua's flag is very similar to the flags of El Salvador and Honduras, as all three were part of the former Federal Republic of Central America that existed from 1823 to 1838. All three countries use the horizontal blue-white-blue stripe pattern. The main differences lie in the central emblems and the exact shades of blue used. Nicaragua features a coat of arms with a triangle containing volcanoes, Honduras displays five blue stars representing the five Central American nations, and El Salvador uses a coat of arms similar to Nicaragua's but with different details. Guatemala's flag also shares Central American heritage but uses vertical stripes instead of horizontal ones. Costa Rica diverged more significantly by adding a red stripe. These similarities honor the shared dream of Central American unity."

Authentic flags should follow the official specifications established in 1971, including the 3:5 aspect ratio, equal-width horizontal stripes in cobalt blue and white, and the detailed coat of arms centered on the white stripe. You can find flags ranging from small handheld versions (typically 4x6 inches) to large institutional flags (5x8 feet or larger). When purchasing, look for flags made from durable materials like nylon or polyester for outdoor use, or cotton for indoor display. Reputable flag manufacturers and international retailers stock Nicaragua flags, and prices typically range from $8 for small flags to $50 or more for large, high-quality versions. For official government use, flags must meet exact specifications, but personal display flags can have some variation."

The flag should never touch the ground, be used as clothing or decoration except in specific patriotic contexts, or be displayed in a damaged or faded condition. During national mourning periods, the flag flies at half-staff. On Flag Day (September 14) and Independence Day (September 15), the flag should be prominently displayed on homes, businesses, and public buildings.

Divide the rectangle into three equal horizontal sections, each occupying one-third of the height. Color the top and bottom sections cobalt blue and leave the middle section white. For the coat of arms, measure one-fifth of the flag's height and draw a circle of that diameter centered on the white stripe. Inside, draw an equilateral triangle, then add five small triangular volcanoes rising from a wavy water base. Above the volcanoes, sketch a rainbow arc, and place a small cap shape on top. Add a circular border around the triangle with the text 'REPÚBLICA DE NICARAGUA' curving along the top and 'AMÉRICA CENTRAL' along the bottom. Use gold for the text and triangle border, blue for water, green for volcanoes, and traditional rainbow colors for the arc. The key is maintaining proper proportions and centering the emblem precisely."
